    <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was 9, my mother enrolled me into a circulating library in Jayanagar 4th
Block. It was named &lt;em&gt;Serene&lt;/em&gt;, and it was operating out of what was a smallish
garage. The &lt;em&gt;librarian&lt;/em&gt;, whose name I cannot really recall (I think it was
Kumar or some other common Kannadiga name), was thin, silent and didn’t strike
me as someone who read himself. It was a living for him.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>When I was 9, my mother enrolled me into a circulating library in Jayanagar 4th
Block. It was named Serene, and it was operating out of what was a smallish
garage. The librarian, whose name I cannot really recall (I think it was
Kumar or some other common Kannadiga name), was thin, silent and didn’t strike
me as someone who read himself. It was a living for him.</summary>

    <title>Python - A Reflection in 2022</title>
    <updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I built my career on Python. In 2014, I had to make a decision. It was between
either choosing to learn Ruby or Python. I was helping to create a tool and
process for a team of content writers at Flipkart – I was a content writer
there, and I’d used Excel for it at first, until Excel couldn’t handle the
queries anymore. I called my friend who recommended Python. I learnt Python,
almost over a course of a weekend, and I was making a PyQT4 application in a few
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
