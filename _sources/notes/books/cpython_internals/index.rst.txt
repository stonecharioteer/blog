CPython Internals - Anthony Shaw
====================================


.. tip::

   This book is a *longer* version of Anthony's `Real Python article,
   <https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/>`_ which you should
   probably read before you read this book. For *most* people, that book should
   be enough.
