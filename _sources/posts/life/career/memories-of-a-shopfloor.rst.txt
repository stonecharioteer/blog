Memories of a Shop Floor
==================================================

.. index:: career, life, manufacturing, mechanical-engineering, TVS, INEL


I began my career as a mechanical engineer working on the shop floor of Harita
Fehrer Ltd. What I was doing had *nothing* to do with code, and *everything* to
do with Software Engineering.

I worked as a quality engineer on the shop floor. My job was making sure that
the instruments that were used to measure our products - Harita Fehrer was into
polyurethane foam manufacturing for seating systems. I learnt statistics at this
company from a man who taught me one of the most important lessons of my life
regarding teaching. You do not need to be fluent in a language to be a great
teacher. I learnt Measurement Systems Analysis from this man, and I am forever
grateful for the oppurtunity.

I moved on to work at India Nippon Electricals Ltd, as an engineer in the "Production
Engineering". This was separate from Production, as it was more related to
process and tooling management. I was in a team where I got to see how the plant
operated - INEL was into manufacturing ignition systems for two wheelers. I also
got to learn a lot about the Toyota Manufacturing System from the General
Manager of the plant - a man who taught me things that I never realize that I
would need in a career at software development.

The things I learnt at these companies taught me a lot about processes. I learnt
about statistics, and I continue to think about how much there is in common
between software engineering and a shop floor.
