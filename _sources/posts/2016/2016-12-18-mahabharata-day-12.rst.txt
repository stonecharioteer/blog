Bhishma Parva.

Here it all begins. The story of the downfall of the Kuru Dynasty, the downfall
of the sons of Dhritarashtra.  As I sit atop the mountain where Hanuman, the
Lord of the Vanaras is supposed to have been born, I see.  I see the mound of
rock where I have sat the last few days, reading the Mahabharata.  I see the
Tungabhadra, dried up and dying because of the drought.

I see the Virupaksha temple, and the entire region called Kishkinda.  Sight is
a very important thing, especially to a blind man. So, when Krishna Dvaipayana,
the twenty-eighth of those called Vyaasa, offered Dhritarashtra sight to see
the war and its aftermath, how did he refuse it?  How indeed did Sanjaya accept
that burden, and how did he bear it, having to recite the events as they
happened?

It makes sense then, that the first thing Sanjaya does after receiving this
divine gift is to exclaim in awe at the death of Bhishma of the terrible oath.
It makes sense that hindsight is indeed perfect.

Today, I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. Atop the
Anjanadri mountain, where Anjana devi is supposed to have meditated for
centuries, birthing a son who would make the very mountains his playground. And
like his fluttering likeness on Dhananjeya's chariot, the monkey God must
surely be listening as I read out the story that contains all stories.
