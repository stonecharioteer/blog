A Career in Programming
=============================================

.. note::

   This is a talk I was originally preparing to deliver at the University of Utah's
   Master of Computer Science program. I want to do this very differently,
   and make it a very, very fancy presentation. I want to essentially build a
   WASM-based game that I host online and use as slides. I would like to build
   a platformer that I can use to show my journey, and where I am right now.
   I'd like to use it to show how you can learn software programming without a
   background in tech.
