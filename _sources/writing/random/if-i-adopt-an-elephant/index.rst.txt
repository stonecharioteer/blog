If I adopt an elephant...

----

  |  If I adopt an elephant,
  |  I would name him *Puttu*
  |  to remind him that no matter how
  |  gigantic he gets, he's still my baby.
  |
  |  I'd buy a sugarcane farm to feed him,
  |  and I'd hire a *mahouta* to teach him manners.
  |  I'd teach my children to ask him not
  |  for rides, but instead to ask him
  |  to pet them with his trunk.
  |  I'd teach him to sit and trumpet
  |  for bananas, and to roll
  |  in the dirt in summers to beat the heat.
  |
  |  I'd hire a stonemason to make
  |  a ginormous stone table
  |  outside our house so he
  |  can sit with us and eat
  |  banana leaves while we eat
  |  on banana leaves.
  |  But we never feed him used leaves.
  |  He is family after all.
  |
  |  I will teach my children to call him Puttu *Anna,*
  |  because he'd be their elder,
  |  and their children's children will
  |  call him Puttu *Thaata.*
  |
  |  I'll teach him to help bathe the dogs,
  |  because whatever they run from, they
  |  won't be able to run from
  |  an elephant's spray of water.
  |
  |  Subbalakshmi will need to teach Puttu
  |  to be gentle, as gentle as she
  |  is around smaller creatures,
  |  and more so around the cats, because
  |  they will perhaps fear him if he is loud.
  |
  |  Vibhishana, perhaps, will respect him,
  |  or perhaps he will win *him* over as well,
  |  Ganga will rest on his head,
  |  loving him as she loves all, perhaps more,
  |  And Yamuna, well, maybe she will trust him at least.
  |
  |  When I read outside,
  |  which I will do every day,
  |  I will teach him to sit next to
  |  me, because I will read to him.
  |
  |  I will tell him the stories
  |  of Gajendra and Ganesha,
  |  and tell him how stupid
  |  humans are for either
  |  deifying or harassing animals
  |  as noble as him. He is not
  |  God, he is no monster.
  |  I will tell him what he is:
  |  *Family.*
  |
  |  When I die,
  |  I want my grandchildren
  |  to play videos and audio of me reading to
  |  him so he can hear me and watch me
  |  read even when I am gone.
  |
  |  I want my ashes mixed in a river
  |  where he can bathe,
  |  so he will know I am still
  |  bathing him.
  |
  |  I want an elephant,
  |  not so I can adopt him,
  |  but so he can adopt me.
  |  I want to find him a mate, and
  |  I want to watch his calves frolic
  |  in our sugarcane farm.
  |
  |  I want his children to call
  |  my children their own,
  |  so that the line between our
  |  families is thinned. Perhaps one day,
  |  he will name one of his children after
  |  me, and one of my grandchildren can be
  |  named after him.

   This is an updated version of a bit I'd once written and posted on
   Instagram. I wrote this before I had pets of my own, and I wanted them to be
   a part of it, hence the edit.
