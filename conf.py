# up project building.

# -- Blog Authors, Languages, and Locations -----------------------------------

# A dictionary of author names mapping to author full display names and
# links. Dictionary keys are what should be used in ``post`` directive
# to refer to the author.  Default is ``{}``.

# Default is ``{}``.

# }


# A dictionary of location names mapping to full display names and

# in archive pages.  This option can be set on a per post basis using
# post_auto_excerpt = 1

# Index of the image that will be displayed in the excerpt of the post.
# Default is ``0``, meaning no image.  Setting this to ``1`` will include
# the first image, when available, to the excerpt.  This option can be set

# behavior when :rst:dir:`post` is used multiple times in a document. Default
# is ``False``.
# post_always_section = False

# When ``False``, the :rst:dir:`orphan` directive is not automatically set
# for each post. Without this directive, Sphinx will warn about posts that

# -- ABlog Sidebars -------------------------------------------------------
