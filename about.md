# Vinay Keerthi

I am a software developer based in Bangalore, India. I write about technology,
Python, Raspberry Pi, the Internet of Things, and I also speak at Meetups and
Conferences.

I also write about hearing loss and single-sided deafness, and how to cope with it.

# My Gear

I am a certified geek. I build mechanical keyboards, run Kubernetes on a 4 node Raspberry Pi 4 bramble (a smaller cluster), have about 18 Raspberry Pi boards in all, and I also do a lot of MicroPython and IoT work.

Here's a small gallery of my work.

## Why Stonecharioteer?

I was born in Hampi, Karnataka, India, and I often write about it as well. I was lucky enough to find the domain, and the ID in all my frequent portals.

The logo was designed by my sister Sthuthi Kiran.
