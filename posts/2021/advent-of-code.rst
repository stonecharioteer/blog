I'm working on this year's `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/2021>`_
problems. I have wanted to work on this *live* for several years now, and
this year, I've started allocating *some* time to this every day.

I'm working on the problems in Python first, but I want to cover more languages.
I want to learn Rust, as I've been saying for quite some time, but I also want
to learn other languages. For the outset, the languages I'd like to target, in
no particular order, are:

1. Python
2. Rust
3. Golang
4. Elixir
5. Ruby
6. Nodejs

My targets for doing AoC are fairly simple:

1. I'd like to be able to code in multiple languages.
2. I want to learn from some of the examples on `/r/adventofcode
   <https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode>`_
3. I want to be able to write a CLI in all the aforementioned languages. As
   I've described in the `README.rst,
   <https://github.com/stonecharioteer/advent-of-code/tree/master/README.rst>`_
   I'd like to run the code for a particular day using a CLI that I'm going to
   reimplement in *each* language. The CLI syntax is described in the ``README`` and
   I'm not replicating that here.
4. I want to learn how to structure code in multiple languages.
5. I want to improve my problem-solving skills.
6. I want to start competitive programming. It's one of the most rewarding
   hobbies to have, especially if you're job hunting. I do poorly on
   problem-solving interviews and I want to change that.

Follow along as I'm coding, and feel free to ask me about my progress. If
there's anything interesting, I'm going to expand upon the solution within a
README for the year. I'll also attempt to recreate others' solutions and learn
from them. This should be fun!
