I've been silent for a while, not because I haven't been writing,
but *because* I've been writing. I've been working on a few blog articles,
primary of which is a *rather* long article on `Oso <https://www.osohq.com>`_
and how you can use it for authorization. This is an article I've been working
on for a few months, and it is *rather* long. I want to get it out there this month,
since I'd originally promised the article to the folks at Oso in Jan 2021.

I've updated the blog to ditch Jekyll. I abhor Markdown for writing of all formats,
and I've been busy changing the blog structure so that it can use `ablog,
<https://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_ which uses `Sphinx,
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ in all of its goodness. I am very
happy with the results, but I'd like to figure out how to use the `Furo theme
<https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo>`_ with ablog as well. All in due time.

I'm also migrating my `notes <https://notes.stonecharioteer.com>`_ to :ref:`here <notes>`, and I'm
going to figure out a way to link my TIL list which is currently in Notion now,
to this blog.

I'm coding again, at least I *will* be. I want to do the `Advent of Code
<https://www.adventofcode.com>`_ challenge this year. I'm not saying I want to
get on the leaderboard, but I want to finish all the exercises, and backfill
the previous years' exercises too. More on that later in a dedicated article.

I hope I can write more this month. If there are kinks in the blog, *and there
will be*, please contact me on `twitter.
