# The Song of a Hero - Insomniac's Spider-Man Miles Morales

Of all the differences between the first Spider-Man game for the
PS4 and Spider-Man Miles Morales, I did not expect to be wowed
by the music.

I read somewhere, how *heroic* music is very prominently composed
of horns, trumpets and other instruments that are *very* prominent.

Superman has the John Williams theme, as majestic as Christopher Reeve
himself. Of all of the Batman themes, the Danny Elfman theme comes
to mind first, being the fan of *Batman: The Animated Series* that I am,
but even with the Hans Zimmer themes, you get similar notes.

I am no musician, but it is hard to *not* feel a strong *energy* coursing
through you when you hear those notes. A *hero* is coming. He *will* save you.
*She* will save you. That's what the Wonder Woman theme that stole the show in
the otherwise mediocre *Batman v. Superman* declared.  Strong cellos that
brought an *electric* atmosphere to the fight instantly. Unlike her peer's
themes, she does not hold back. Instantly you know that a *Saviour* has
arrived.

And with the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, you got the Nickelback song
that didn't care for subtlety. *Hero*. It was outright in its intention.
Spider-Man was the hero.

And this carried forth to the video games.

With the Arkham video games, the Dark Knight set the standard for Superhero
video games. With the music as well. You got to *Be the Batman* with the OST
for the game reminding you that you are a seasoned hero.  The Dark Knight.
Strong, bold bass notes play the orchestra to the hospitalization of your foes.
Those insane enough to take on the World's Greatest Detective were pummelled,
serenaded by music that fit the tone.

The music of a *hero*.

If you grew up playing the Spider-Man games of yesteryears, you *know*
how much of a love-song the *Insomniac* Playstation 4 game is. You
*know* what it feels to be Peter Parker, seasoned Superhero. You
know inside that *with Great Power comes Great Responsibility.*
And the music that you play along to, knows that.

It begins, a soft climb, as it builds, as a spider does, a magnificient
assembly of strength and hope. It knows that Peter Parker is *greater* with
this story. He has earned his mantle in the halls of Marvel's greatest
superheroes. And despite all the efforts of one grumpy podcaster, Spider-Man
is, in *every* sense of the word, a Hero.  If you didn't know that getting into
the game, the music reminds you.  You have great power. And the responsibility
that comes with it.


That's the music you get when you get the *Advanced Suit*. The first in-story
suit. A suit fit for a hero.

And three days ago, I began playing the new Spider-Man Miles Morales
game.

And something struck me immediately. The music broke past this stereotype.

Miles is not a hero. He's a kid who's trying on a mask that fits way *too*
loosely. He is trying to swing to a song that was never written for him.
He is spinning a web that *he believes* is not his.

And the music follows suit. Hidden between the original Insomniac theme
are notes of *something* else. When Miles finally makes his own suit,
he is reintroduced to us. Not with the Insomniac music, but a song.

[Lecrae's This is My Time](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NuO1kL7vrWOX8P63qsCsb?si=DavxJ-AiTEWAFcvSR_UZjw)
serenades Miles into the main stage, as he realizes that it is
time for him to be his own Spider-Man. Not one who has years
of heritage behind him, heritage that is not his own, but one
who has to make his own unique webs.

And spin them he does. As the game veers to its ending, pieces of
the original theme meld with Miles' unique spin on them, choosing
notes and themes that show you that *yes, this is another Spider-Man*,
*but no, he is not "the other Spider-Man".*

Symbolism 101: point to Insomniac.

This is a *beautiful* game. Go buy it. Play it. *Be greater.*
