=========================
Onward
=========================

I'm beginning this year *hopeful*. It's been a long three years, and I have a
lot to do. I'm focussing this year on doing things, which is something I've
said multiple times last year as well. But this year, I'm working on fixing
this.

I've been trying to work on how I solve problems, learning algorithms and data
structures.  This is something that's been on my mind for a while. I'm a first
principles learner, so learning without understanding will not work for me. I
once thought it prudent to try and write a complete textbook on a topic in
college instead of sitting and doing what I needed to ace an exam. Others might
see that as a fallacy, but I see it as a personality trait that I need to hone.

I also want to hold back on being *available*. I have a bad habit of offering
help even when the other person hasn't asked me, and that has cost me my mental
health. I need to hold back, stop being there for people who never asked. This
includes friends who didn't say they need me, and the *kids* I am currently
mentoring. I'm going to hold back. This means no more asking how someone is
doing, how someone is coping, how someone is faring. All those mean the same,
but I'm leaving that as is.

It might sound cold, but perhaps that's what I need. I need to focus on my own
mental health for a while.

And that's another topic. I've begun therapy. I've strongly suspected I have
ADHD for the longest time, and I've sought the help of a local hospital for the
associated tests. I've spoken to a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist so far, and
I'm waiting for the results of several tests, including an :abbr:`MCMI (Millon
Clinical Multiaxial Inventory)`, Beck's Depression Inventory, Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale, an ADHD Self-Report Scale Checklist. I have strong
suspicions that it is ADHD, and I'm hoping I can find ways to cope with it.

I've never been good on things that require me to work *normally*. I mean I am
horrible at doing repetitive tasks, or tasks I deem boring. I'm not good at
working on *easy* problems, and this has been affecting how I work. I want to
solve this. This has been annoying me for a long time, and I suspect this is
what made working at Visa boring to me. I was not required to work on hard problems.
This makes my todo-list really, really long. In fact, I have several dozen blog posts
that are mere drafts because of this. I'd like to change that.

I don't make resolutions, I never keep them. Instead I'm going to start 2022
with a prayer.  A wish. Some hope. I hope I can follow through, figure out why
I cannot focus on my plans.  I want to be able to focus on writing once again,
to be able to focus on what matters to me.  I want to be able to write stories
again, to code for *fun* once again, and to just have fun with life. I've not
been able to do that for 3 years now. And I want to change that.
