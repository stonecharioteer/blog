"Date","Distance Per Session","Particulars"
"February 2023","50m ","First month of lessons, unable to cross the 15m mark out of fear. Still having trouble with freestyle swimming, can do 2 strokes before having to stand because I can't breathe."
"March 2023","100m","I managed to get till the 20 m marker, but I was still unable to freestyle swim. I was flailing all over the place, and I was capsizing."
"April 2023","100m (not sure)","I skipped about 2 weeks in April, mostly because I was out of town, but I returned mid-April I think. I was still struggling to complete laps of 25m."
"May 2023","300m","I am still at the 25m mark, but my coach helped me dive into the deep end 2-3 times on my last day before my break."
"June 2023","-","Didn’t go to the classes; attempted to swim in my neighborhood pool, but didn’t enjoy it as such."
"July 2023","300m – 500m","I returned to classes after a 45day break, was able to go till the 25m mark, but for the entire of July, I stuck to 25m. Managed to do about 10 laps in all by the end of July."
"August 2023","500m-600m","I began focussing on my leg skills, using the kickboard to go till 25, and then 35m without stopping. Once I managed to do a week of 35m laps, my friends helped motivate me to go to the deep end once more. I dove into the deep end a couple of times, but I’m still unable to thread water. I want to build up the endurance to do multiple laps of this pool."
"August 21, 2023","600m","I’m managing to do 150m using the kickboard, and I’m feeling the burn on my legs. It is a great feeling, being in the water again. And the best part is that I’m making tangible progress now!"
"August 24 2023","600m","300m freestyle; 250m kickboard; 50m backstroke."
"August 28, 2023","700m","300m freestyle (2-3 stops per 50m, but I’m working on taking in 2 sets of strokes before I take a breath); 
300m with the kickboard (I do the entire 300m without stopping now)
100m backstroke (with kickboard) - I did 25m x 2 sets (so that’s 50m x 2).

That’s 700m in all!"
