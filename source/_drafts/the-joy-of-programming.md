This talk was delivered to the students of the Master of Software Development program at the University of Utah on April 28th, 2021. I have a recording of this talk uploaded on Youtube, here.

My first 'computer' was the Atari 600XL. My father bought it when he was in the
Middle East, and he never knew that his sisters would learn to write BASIC on
it in a village in India. It is quite possible that my aunts were the first
women programmers in the country, learning to output music from this device in
the early 1980s. I wish I could tell you that they went on to have successful
careers as programmers and engineers. No, they never got that opportunity.
College was an expense that my family could not dream of in those days.

Eventually, the run down Atari came to my possession. I was in the 7th grade,
and I remember playing a game called River Raid on it. It was a fun game, and I
remember playing on it for days at end. I encountered the BASIC programming
manual, but by the time I got my hands on the Atari, the keyboard did not work
so well. I never got around to writing BASIC.

I eventually got my first computer in 2001, an Intel Pentium 4 with 128 MB RAM
and 40 GB storage. It was a machine I loved, and I still possess - in my
garage.

I used the computer to watch anime, play Age of Mythology, read books and write
the next great fantasy novel. But my favourite story about my first computer
was that the very night I received it, I looked at the back, found a switch
that said 220V and toggled it to set it to 110V - in hopes of saving power.

The technician laughed when I told him what I did and why I did it. He told my
father this:

> Make sure he gets a chance to become a computer engineer.

My father tried his best, but I never really did well with standardized
testing. I didn't qualify for a computer science degree, so I opted for
Mechanical Engineering - in hopes of changing my major later in the course. I
could not afford the fees that we needed to pay for a change in majors, and I
stuck with Mechanical Engineering for 4 years. I enjoyed the course, and I
found that I loved working with my hands. I eventually went on to work at a
motorcycle company, and worked in factories for 3 years. I spent the time
learning MS Excel and quite a bit of statistics, to analyse shop floor
efficiency. I had an excellent teacher, a wise and very inspiring General
Manager who I interacted with only for a few times over a year. He told me that
a well-run shop floor will *sound* good. And he taught me the importance of
statistical process control.

In 2012, my father had a heart attack and we didn't have any insurance. I'm
going to spare you the agony of hearing that story, and tell you that he made
it out alive, and I came out of the hospital with a desire to improve our
family's financial position.

The classical engineering industry does not pay very much, at least in India.
I knew that I couldn't take the low pay and the longer hours any longer and I
decided to move on from the factories and joined Amazon's biggest competitor in
India - Flipkart - as a content writer for books. I finally had my dream job.

It was a job where I would write about books, all day long. As someone who
loved to read, this was brilliant. I did well in my role, but I realized that I
wrote *fast*.  I was faster than most other writers there, and I soon began
taking on other tasks.

The team would fill in Google Spreadsheets with their daily writing records,
and the team leads would make everyone take turns filling the sheets in. If
there is one thing you need to know about Spreadsheets, it is that a lack of
discipline does not give itself to the process.

I began thinking how *I* would improve this process. I became known as an Excel
Wizard, and I was trying my best to change my process - until I slowly hit the
bottle neck.

Processing power.

There was only so much I could do to collate 25 sheets of 100 records each per
day using Google Spreadsheets back then. I didn't know anything about
programming the sheets, I was just using two simple formulae to work my magic.

I called up one of my old school friends and she told me that I needed to
either use Ruby or Python for the job. I called another, since I didn't know
the difference between the two, and he said I should use Python.

I learnt Python over a weekend, and macguyvered a desktop application that
would create reports for the team leads to use and to assign work to the
writers.

I eventually wrote other software for the company, a tool to create
infographics, and another to make reports for writers.

I realized that I could write software, and I wanted to try getting a job as a
developer.  It seemed easy enough. I applied to some companies, and took the
first offer I got.

I became a Systems Engineer, a strange way of saying Software Developer, at a
company called GKN.  I worked there for three years and built software for,
oddly enough, Mechanical Engineers.  I worked for a German manager, a man who
set my imagination free and helped me learn so much.  However, I was the only
software engineer there and I wanted to go to a company where I could find my
peers.

My name is Vinay Keerthi and I am a Senior Software Engineer at Visa Inc. I
build scalable, secure solutions for engineers across the floor, and I commit
my free time to speaking at conferences and meetups.

My journey in tech is not new. It is like so many others who have moved from
careers in different fields, some even more alien to Software Development than
mine.

When Dr. Shankar asked me to deliver this talk, I was both excited and
confused. What did I have to tell to students getting a Master's degree in
Software Development? To me, my journey felt so haphazard and without a plan.
I *fumbled* into a career in Software Development.

I have tried mentoring others to follow my path. Some of them have taken to it
like a dog to a bone, while others have rejected it and stuck to their own
paths. I do not blame them. This path is not as easy as it might seem to one
who has scaled it, partway at least.

However, this is what I've learned from my path.

I bought my first Raspberry Pi in 2014. I was fascinated by it, a device that I
could install Linux in, and use as a full computer.  At 256MB RAM, it was
already more powerful than my first desktop! So I bought one. Over the years, I
bought several Raspberry Pis. I own about 20 of them today.

I don't use them for work. I think IT would have a fit if they knew I carried a
Raspberry Pi with me *everywhere* I went.

Why do I carry it everywhere?

Well, it's because it's both a talking point, and it's something that I can
hook up to a display and use with my keyboards.
