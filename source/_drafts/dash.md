## Introduction

Dash is a Python library from Plotly that helps you take graphs that are generated using Plotly and then convert them
into a web page.

In simple terms, Dash does just this. However, what Dash does internally is take your Python objects that define
your views and convert them into React components. This is a powerful way of building React applications without
having to write your own React code.

Dash also uses Flask internally, converting all your function calls into Flask API calls. This makes it easy to decouple
the application and build a full stack application purely in Python.

Note that by saying we are writing Python for the UI, I don't mean that we are using WASM. This approach has nothing
to do with Web Assembly. Instead, it is a simpler way to just take Python code and generate Javascript.

## Prerequisites

To understand this article, you should have an understanding of the following items.

1. Python: Learn how decorators work, how to write class definition and how methods are called.
2. Flask: Go through a good tutorial on flask. You will need to understand blueprints, the Application factory method approach, and MethodViews.
3. Plotly: Some minor understanding of the Plotly library is required.
4. HTML and CSS: While JS is not required to build your own Dash apps, I'd recommend getting to learn as much HTML and CSS as you can since that will help you polish your application.

Resources for all these can be found at the end of this article.

## Setup and Installation

Get the source code for this repository. Make sure you get all the tags.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stonecharioteer/dash-spa
cd dash-spa
git fetch --all --tags --prune
```

Then, checkout the first version of this application.

```bash
git checkout v0.1
```

First, as you always should, make a virtual environment using a Python 3 (I use 3.8).

```bash
python3 -m venv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

This application uses `gunicorn` for deployment. I have provided a sample `wsgi.py` file
for use with `gunicorn`. So go ahead and use it.

```bash
gunicorn -w 6 -b 0.0.0.0:10000 wsgi:app
```


## Structure of the Application

This application is broken into two portions. The first portion is the Flask application,
while the other portion is the Dash application. Dash builds up an application *above* a Flask app by default. However, it can be explicitly attached to a Flask application.

I personally recommend the latter method.

### Flask Structure

### Dash Structure

## Testing the Application

### Testing the Utilities

### Testing the Flask API

### Testing the Dash UI with Selenium

#### Note on User Acceptance Tests

## Dash Callbacks

## Deployment

### Using `systemctl` and `gunicorn`

### Using `docker`

#### Using `docker-compose`

### Using Kubernetes

#### Pushing Updates to Settings

## Using the cookiecutter Template
