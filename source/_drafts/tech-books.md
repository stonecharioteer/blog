categories: [books]
---


Below are a list of books I am reading (or I am planning on reading) this year
that are related to tech.


1. A Little Schemer

    I am surprised by this book. It is definitely a breath of fresh air. To
    think someone would have the idea of using the Socratic Method to teach
    programming!

2. A Little Java

    See 1. above for why I would want to read this.

3. CPython Internals by Anthony Shaw

    I bought an early release of this book on Real Python. Cannot wait to get
    started!

4. Robot Building for Beginners by David Cook

    A close friend told me that David Cook's blog and books are excellent
    resources in electronics and hardware. I do quite a bit of electronics
    already, but I understand very little of what I am doing. I bought this
    and the next book two years ago, and this is a great time to read both.

5. Intermediate Robot Building by David Cook

    See #4 above for why I want to read this.

6. Inclusive Design for Products
7. Inclusive Design for Organizations
8. Mismatch
9. Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
10. The Rust Programming Language
11. An Introduction to Programming in Go
12. Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach
