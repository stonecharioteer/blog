Come, let me tell you the story of Rama.

And it *is* the story of Rama, child, even if you have heard another version.

Dasaratha was once King of Men, ruling over all in Varanasi. He was a great King, benevolent and wise. And he pined for a son. He prayed to the Gods and they delivered unto him two mighty sons and a daughter.

First of his blood was he who is called Rama. His brother was the devoted Lakkanna, called Lakshmana by some.

Their *sister*, and listen carefully child because so many tell this story differently because *that* is how great Rama is, was the beautiful Sita.

*No!* You say? You say Sita was Rama's wife? Is not Rama worth a million retellings and versions? Listen, child, to *my* rendition, and tell me then of your Rama. For what is a God if he is not at once in a million forms?

*

One day, I will tell a story of Rama. One day.

And that day, it will be a story, but it might not be the one you know.

Yet, it will be Rama.
