Despite my fear of tanks and wells, I love water.

I am enthralled by it. The motion of streams mystifies me. The sound of a river flowing with all its might inspires me.

Rivers drive me to write, they inspire me.

Some people are of the cities. Some are of the mountains. But I? I am a soul of the trees and the rivers.
