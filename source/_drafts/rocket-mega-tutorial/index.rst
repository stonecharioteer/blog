The Rocket Mega-Tutorial
=================================================

.. note::
   This tutorial adapts Miguel Grinberg's `Flask Mega-Tutorial
   <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>`_
   for use with Rocket and Rust. I'm using this as a runway to
   learn Rust and Rocket myself, and found that the way Miguel
   teaches to have worked really well for me.

   At the outset, I'm copying the structure of Miguel's course completely, but
   I might adapt some sections as I see fit, since deploying Rust applications
   is largely different from deployment Python applications.

Welcome to the Rocket Mega-Tutorial. I began writing these articles in order to
better understand Rocket myself. I'm a newcomer to Rust, and I need to build a
really fast webservice at work, which is why I considered Rust in the first
place. I remembered how quickly the Flask Mega-Tutorial helped me learn Flask,
and I decided to mimic its spirit for a Rocket tutorial. You *do* need to know
a little Rust to be able to go through this course, and if you're in the mood
for a book, I'd recommend the `Rust Web Programming
<https://www.packtpub.com/product/rust-web-programming/9781800560819>`_ book
which has a really good starting point for learning Rust. Alternately, you
might want to read the `Rust Book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>`_, or `Rust
in Action <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>`_. You don't need to read all these
books, just get a little comfortable with the language syntax because I'm going
to be doing a *lot* of hand-holding when writing these tutorials.
