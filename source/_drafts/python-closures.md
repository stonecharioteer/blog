## Preamble 

About a year ago, a friend and I were discussing closures in programming
languages, and how they were treated so specially in many technical circles.
To us, the concept seemed weird. Python's closures were... *intuitive*, weren't
they?  Both of us were not exactly from a standard programming background, we'd
both studied Mechanical Engineering, not Computer Science, but we were (and
still are) super passionate about tech.

Which is why we were confused. Whatever it is that the world calls **closures**
seems pretty obvious. At least to us they were.

And well, we weren't wrong. But we were mildly surprised at how Python deals
with it.

## Intended Audience

This is an intermediate level article, and you might be confused reading it if
you don't understand the following:

1. [Writing Python scripts.](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
2. [Using the REPL Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)
3. [Writing functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
4. [Writing classes (knowledge of inheritance is not required)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
5. Using the [`id`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id),
   [`help`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help) and
   [`dir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir) functions.
6. [Using the `dis` module to disassemble Python code.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html)

I have linked to the best articles (IMO) on these topics above, so if you like,
you can go ahead and read those first.

Also, most articles deal with an article with respect to nested functions.
While I *do* deal with nested functions, I do not start there. I start earlier,
with a simple variable, and build up to nested... let's say objects.


## Introduction

Let's take a look.

```python
def some_func():
    something_to_return = 10
    print(f"id(something_to_return) = {id(something_to_return)}")
    return something_to_return
```

The `id` function in Python is a built-in that 
[returns the *identity*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id)
of the object that represents the variable. I use this function to sniff around
my code to see if I am passing around copies of a variable or if I am actually
passing the variable (*sic* object) itself.

In this case, it is easy to test this theory.

```
>>> x = some_func()
id(something_to_return) = 10917664
>>> id(x)
10917664
```

This snippet prints out the `id` value of these variables, and while of course
this number will vary, and it could be the same, but for objects with
non-overlapping lifetime.  In other words, during one specific *scope*, these
numbers are guaranteed to be representative of a specific object.

## Scopes

The *scope* that I just brought up is, in very simple terms, like a space for
your code to run in. In python, variables are shared from an outer scope to an
inner scope.


```python
def test():
    x = 10

print(x) # This will result in a NameError exception since x was defined inside a function.

test()
print(x)
# no, calling the function doesn't add whatever is inside magically to
# the "higher" scope"
```

A higher scope is indicative of a scope that contains another scope. If that is
too wordy for your taste:

```python
# this is scope 0
def func():
    # this is scope 1
    def func2():
        # this is scope 2
        pass
    pass 
```

In this example, scope 0 *contains* scope 1. Scope 1 *contains* scope 2.
However, everything in scopes 0 and 1 are accessible in scope 2, and everything
in scope 0 is accessible to scope 0.

Scope 0 is the outermost scope. Scope 1 is inside scope 0. Scope 1 is outside
of scope 2. Scope 2 is inside scope 1.

This will become clearer in time.

## Sniffing around returned values

Now, let's look back at our closures. We saw that the `id` value of the integer
that was returned is the same. which means, technically, that the same object
was returned into the outer scope from the inner scope.

Let's expand this example.

```python

def func():
    x = 10
    print(id(10))
    return x

external_x = func()
print(id(external_x))

def func2(inp):
    print(id(inp))
    return inp

external_inp = func2(external_x)
print(id(external_inp))
assert external_x is external_inp, "The item is not the same. This assertion should not have been raised"
```

When I run the above snippet, here's what I get:

```
94093123237024
94093123237024
94093123237024
94093123237024
```

If you are following along, this means that the application passed around a
variable `x`, created *inside* `func`, outside of its scope, and then *into*
the scope of another function that returned it unmodified, and the `id` was
never changed. This means that all through your process, you passed around a
single object. You did not change it.

Now, you might wonder if this would work.

```python
def func():
    x = 10
    print(id(x))
    return x

ext_x = func()
print(id(ext_x))

def func2(inp):
    inp = inp**2
    return inp

ext_x2 = func2(ext_x)
print(id(ext_x2))
assert ext_x is ext_x2, "the objects are not the same"
```

When I run this, here's what I get:

```
94093123237024
94093123237024
94093123239904
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-bb929bfaec24> in <module>
     13 ext_x2 = func2(ext_x)
     14 print(id(ext_x2))
---> 15 assert ext_x is ext_x2, "the objects are not the same"

AssertionError: the objects are not the same
```

This doesn't work. Why? Let's take it apart using another tool in the python
standard library, the `dis` module.

## Disassembling our snippets

```python
import dis
print("Disassembling the first snippet")
dis.dis("""
def func():
    x = 10
    print(id(10))
    return x

external_x = func()
print(id(external_x))

def func2(inp):
    print(id(inp))
    return inp

external_inp = func2(external_x)
print(id(external_inp))
assert external_x is external_inp, "The item is not the same. This assertion should not have been raised"
""")
###
print("Disassembling the failing snippet")
dis.dis("""
def func():
    x = 10
    print(id(x))
    return x

ext_x = func()
print(id(ext_x))

def func2(inp):
    inp = inp**2
    return inp

ext_x2 = func2(ext_x)
print(id(ext_x2))
assert ext_x is ext_x2, "the objects are not the same"
""")

```

When you run this file, you should see the following output. Do not be too
intimidated by how long it seems, it is fairly easy to understand once you know
how to read it.

[The official python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html)
on the `dis` library is excellent and you should try to go through that before
you read ahead.

## A Personal Story

The conversation at the beginning of this article came about because I had just
come out of an interview where the interviewer asked me to explain Python
closures. I had faltered, not because I didn't know, but because, oddly
enough, I thought there was nothing special about how you can essentially play
ping pong with objects in Python. Most languages do this. Python does this only
because C does it. You can return pointers, can't you?

All in all, a confusing interview let me to understand something in depth, and
helped me learn.
