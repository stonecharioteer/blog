I have been looking for a comfortable 2-in-1 laptop for quite
some time. I was surprised when I decided that the
Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus would be the best device for that usecase.

My needs were simple. The device:

1. should have at least a 12 inch screen.
2. should have a touch screen with a fluid pen experience.
3. should support a Linux terminal.
4. should be light, easy to carry everywhere,
5. should allow me to sync my notes online (preferably both hand-written and
   typed.)
6. should support `vim`.

I recently bought a Dell G5 SE AMD Ryzen 7 Laptop after trying to find
a device that suited my every need. I realized that effort was in vain,
and postponed the hunt. However, after research, I realized that this
was a perfect device.

1. The device comes with Android, which means termux runs brilliantly.
2. It has an amazing 120 Hz Super AMOLED screen (12.4 inches).
3. The S-pen is an *amazing* writing experience.
4. Everything syncs with Google Cloud / Samsung Cloud.

I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I have been using this
to finally make copious notes on all that I read. I am not going to
post these notes on the blog, since they are very **raw** and unfit for
general reading. But they are [available in a public github
repo](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/git).

Here are a few screenshots and photos of the way I use the tab.
