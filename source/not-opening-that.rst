No, I won't open that link

Hello!

I'm not going to open the link you shared because it is to a social network
or short media platform. I've been off some or all of these platforms
`since Jan 2023. </posts/life/no-social-networks.rst>`_

As of Jan 2025, this includes Instagram, X/Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, TikTok and YouTube.
I *refuse* to open links to any of these, and this list will expand to any
other platforms that provide us "infinite-scrolling content" based on
recommendation systems. I'm not trying to be rude, but it's something I've decided
to do for my own sanity. Platforms like these are not only stealing our focus,
they're also min-maxing the time we spend on these apps when we could be doing something
more with our lives, like making friends and reading. Such platforms are a plague
on the Internet and the world would be better without them.

So I must refuse to open this link, and any others you share if they lead to these. If you
want to ask me how to detox your own life from these applications, go right ahead! It's a topic
I enjoy talking about!

Cheers!
