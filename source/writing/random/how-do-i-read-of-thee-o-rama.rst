  | How do I read of thee, O Rama,
  | When your name is a war cry?
  | Not when your Sita is whisked away,
  | But when mobs raise orange flags.
  | 
  | How do I read of thee, O Rama,
  | When blood is spilled at your name?
  | Not when Indrajit fells Lakshmana,
  | But when innocent children are slain?
  | 
  | How do I read of thee, O Rama,
  | When women are raped for you?
  | Not because you asked, no,
  | But because they veil themselves.
  | 
  | How do I read of thee, O Rama,
  | When fire burns saffron in your praise?
  | Agni burns both fakirs and kafirs alike.
  | What does he know of directed malaise?
  | 
  | But I do read of you, Rama,
  | Because they don't.
  | They don't know all your stories,
  | Or your names, from Raghava to Phra Lam.

.. note::

  This is something I wrote on the spur of the moment after
  reading Bhisham Sahni's Tamas, a book on communal hatred.
