----

  | Hate unwittingly has a colour.
  | It changes, to mask what one lacks.
  | If you see hate only without, you ignore it within.
  | Carry your hate on your shoulders, 
  | in big unwieldy sacks.
  | Perhaps then you'll see it weighs you down,
  | Or allow rationale to seep-in.
  | The colour of hate changes, from violet to red,
  | Perhaps to you it is green,
  | But for others saffron is your spleen.
