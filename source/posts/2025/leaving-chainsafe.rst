Leaving ChainSafe Systems

I've left ChainSafe Systems where I spent 25 months working with some of the best minds in the
cryptocurrency world. It was a learning period for me, as most of my career stints have been,
and I've enjoyed my time there.

I'm looking forward to the next journey, and wish the company the best.
