I am terrified of water tanks, stepped wells, regular wells, temple tanks, over
head water tanks, monolithic statues partially or fully submerged. I'm not
fully scared of oceans, rivers, ponds or lakes. What I have is termed
`submechanophobia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submechanophobia>`_, but oddly
enough I'm not too scared of watching documentaries of the Titanic Wreck. I'm
absolutely terrified of looking at even photos or videos of the former stuff
though.

I was not really scared of swimming pools, as long as they're well lit. But I
never ever sat next to a pool and put my feet into the water. I'm only aware of
putting my feet into the Tungabhadra river, because *she* is home.

In February 2023, I began wondering if I should learn to swim. It's an unvoiced
dream, something I'd harboured all my life and I'd never ever imagined that I'd
ever do. I didn't tell anyone because the idea that *I would want to swim*
would usually be followed by "first, learn to go to the main bathroom at
Hampi." My grandmother's house there has a well in the bathroom, and the
bathroom once housed a water tank, because houses there didn't have regular
water supply for a very long time. I used to bathe in the open, in the second
kitchen, in fact, for almost my entire life, because my grandmother promised me
that I could and no one could ever question my right to do so.

My fear of tanks has been misunderstood my entire life. As I type this, I
wonder if I should link to photos of stepped wells and things I'm scared of.
It's ridiculous that I cannot because I'm scared of their mere photos. I will
one day overcome this and write about that as well, because, *besides this
particular fear*, I've already faced one of my largest fear (an article for
later because that will be accompanied by largely unintelligible rants about my
feelings for mythology and my love for stories).

My family never really went about addressing this fear well. They were
dismissive of it, and honestly, I can't blame them. I was a stubborn child. I
only recently learnt how to process my fear.

In February 2023, I decided to enroll for swimming lessons, and I began looking
for schools around my house. I had other problems I somehow overcame thanks to
a good friend. I have been anxious about my appearance since childhood. I was
made fun of for being a fat child, and I've been left out of sports, games, and
it eventually became such that I just *hated* being around other kids my age
because of how alone they made me feel. To add to this, I especially *hated*
wearing shorts. They would emphasize how fat my thighs were, and I didn't want
to relive this. I used to be the person who would wear jeans even in the
*hottest* summers. In January 2023, I went to Auroville and had the toughest
time walking around in jeans. While I switched to kurta trousers, I didn't
really have a great time with them either. My friend Shrayas joined me at
Auroville for the first two days and while he was completely unaware of my
feelings of self-esteem, he was strutting around in shorts and was rather
nonchallant about it. It somehow struck me that I *was* being silly - although
good luck to anyone who would have told me this to my face before my
realization. I came back to Bangalore and began buying shorts. It is funny how
I *almost* always wear only shorts now. I feel super comfortable wearing them,
and if not for that one trip to Auroville and Shrayas telling me he'd join me
on a mere *whim*, I would not have had that epiphany.

So in February, I was completely over my feelings for wearing shorts in public.
I wore my shorts everywhere. I'm halfway certain that some of the shorts I wear
now are mostly boxers, but shame be damned, I'm going to wear shorts.

So when my swimming lessons were to begin, I had the following concerns.

1. What gear to do I need?
2. Will the pool be sufficiently lit?
3. Will the coach throw me into the water for me to get over the fear?
4. Will I even go the second day?
5. Will I get powered swimming goggles? (I have myopia, and I am blind without
   my glasses.)

These were some of the questions I had, and I got answers for the glasses on
Twitter. I was able to find powered swimming goggles and all the gear I needed
at the Decathlon nearby.

I picked Zee Swim Academy just because it said it had a 50m long pool, and that
it trained folks for competitions. The place has a great set of coaches for
para-swimming competitions, and for state and national level children's
competitions. I enquired about the fees and signed up on February 9th, 2023.

My very first day, I was taught a bunch of warmup exercises, and I was asked to
get into the pool using the ladder at the shallow end. I didn't know what to
expect. The water was cold, but fortunately, I'd shifted to cold water baths in
October 2022. I was asked to wade around the water, to walk around the wall,
until the 15m mark. At 15m, my shoulders were inside the water. I'm 5'7", so
the water was about 4" at that point. Then, I was asked to "bubble out",
which is to say, I put my head in the water, look around and exhale slowly.
I was a little anxious, but managed to do this much. I did just this a couple
of times that day, and after 30 to 40 minutes, was asked to get out of the pool
and go home. As I took my first steps outside the pool, I realized that my body
felt so much heavier. After 30 minutes in the water, I felt like I'd somehow
forgotten my body weight.

You must understand, I'd never really exercised until then. I'd been to the gym
for 3 months in 2014, and I'd done 3 months of Yoga in 2019, but I'd never
managed to stay interested in any of these things. I was completely out of shape,
but I wasn't really getting into swimming to get fit or anything.

I returned the second day, and my anxiety was reduced. I was taught how to float,
and I must admit that I capsized like a poorly built cruise ship multiple times.
I felt afraid kicking myself forward from the centre of my lane, away from the wall,
and I felt panic dawning on me as I put my head under the water and lifted my legs up.

The first week, I couldn't even float very well. Sure, I went a bit forward, and I
managed to float a little, but not in a straight line. I was going diagonally, and
when the coach asked me to kick my legs, I could manage only one or two kicks and I
fumbled, standing up out of fear.

The second week, some stuff changed, but most of it managed to stay the same. I could float,
but kicking and going ahead were super difficult. The coach asked me to use the kickboard
to practice floating and kicking as I moved forward, but I'd stop thrice before reaching the
15m mark. Some of my other batch mates were at 25m already.

I learnt somethings about myself, and about teaching in general from this experience.
The coach was super appreciative about any and all progress, and managed to cheer me on
for showing up and staying the entire hour. And I began catching myself every time I reacted
negatively towards failure. It is weird, because I have constantly told myself I do not fear
failure. I thought I did not. It's how I switched my career multiple times, how I managed to
learn things without giving up, especially when it came to my career. And for physical activities,
I just didn't have that same attitude. It might have something to do with the fact that I was 
ridiculed for not performing the morning assembly exercises at school - we had a PE teacher who
should have never been allowed near children - then again, my school in Bangalore
didn't have more than a handful of faculty who should have been near children. I saw the children
at ZSA perform and take their coach's loud admonitions sportively. They cheered one another on,
even in a sport that was not a team activity like football or cricket. It was very different from
the atmosphere I was used to.

I went to classes each week, and my growth was slow, but it was visible. After
two months of classes, I managed to reach the 25m mark by swimming with the kickboard,
although doing so with the freestyle strokes was hard. I would stop multiple times to reach
the point, and even then, at each stop I'd pause for minutes to catch my breath.

One day, after 2 months of classes, my coach called me to the deep end of the
pool. I had not crossed the 25m mark, where I had to bounce up and down to keep
my head out of the water. I was terrified, but my batch mates were also with
me, and just recently, I'd been reminded of the one thing that would make a
world of difference in my journey.


.. admonition:: The Litany Against Fear
   :class: danger

   | I must not fear.
   | Fear is the mind-killer.
   | Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
   | I will face my fear.
   | I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
   | And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
   | Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
   | Only I will remain.
   |

When I stood over the deep end, trying to get into it so I could swim to
*safety*, all I told myself was this. *Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the
little-death that brings total obliteration.* I repeated this under my breath
several times, and then jumped into the water. The first time my toes touched
the bottom of the deep end, I felt... nothing. I didn't feel like I'd die, I
didn't feel like I'd erupt from fear. I really felt nothing. Only I remained.
My choices mattered. I began kicking my feet, and my body began to remember
that it could swim. I rose upwards, and I began moving forward, toward the
safety of the wall.

Doing it again a second and third time that day was still terrifying, and I
hoped I would not have to do it again for a while. But I felt *good*. I did it.
I was in the deep end. I *still* didn't know how to swim well, or honestly at
*all*, but I did this.

I returned to swimming classes in July, after wrapping up a bunch of things I
needed to in my private life, and I was doing worse than before. My batch mates
had reached the deep end. I didn't feel left behind, since everyone was
cheering me on, and telling me that I'd do it in no time.

I was still stopping thrice to reach 25m, and for the rest of July, I spent my
efforts on building my endurance. I tried to show up four times a week, and I
pushed myself to swim till 25m every time. Things managed to improve, but I was
still faltering and having trouble with swimming freestyle. But things
improved.

You could say I spent about 3 months' worth of classes before I managed to swim
to the 35m mark with the kickboard. I was still uncomfortable there, and I
stuck close to the wall, but surely yet steadily, I managed to push myself
further and further.

And one day, I decided to return to the deep end. Fear is the mind-killer, I
told myself, and I jumped back into the deep end and swam freestyle. To my
surprise, I swam 35m without stopping. I must have made 18 stroke repetitions
in all, and I managed to go without stopping.

From that day on, I returned to the pool, urging myself to swim to the deep
end. It took me almost 4 months, but I did it. I manage to swim 150m without
stopping when using the kickboard, and without the kickboard, I manage to get
to the deep end (50m) only stopping once or twice at most. I'm managing to jump
into the deep end, and I'm able to dunk myself until the bottom and rise
upwards again, confident that I will not fear.

I will not fear.

Something changes in you, when you face your fear. It dawns on you that
somehow, doing the thing that you are terrified of, gives you willpower and
energy. It doesn't make you powerful, or a different person. Fear, quite
simply, is the mind-killer. I am still not going to go near wells, stepped
wells, overhead water tanks, reservoirs, or even near overly large water drums,
but I will push myself to swim as much as I can.

Learn to swim. You will love every minute of it.
