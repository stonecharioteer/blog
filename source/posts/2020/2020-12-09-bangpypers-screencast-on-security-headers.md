# BangPypers Screencast On Security Headers

The video for my screencast has finally been uploaded. This was a screencast conducted by BangPypers.
Here, I covered the topics I blogged about in [this article]({% post_url 2020-11-11-web-application-security %}).

This was the first of BangPypers' adhoc talks that aren't quite prescheduled, and this is the first time I spoke without having much of a preparation time.

Do reach out to me to discuss this talk, or for questions.
