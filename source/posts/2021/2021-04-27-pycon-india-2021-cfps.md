[PyCon India is accepting Calls for Proposals](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2021/proposals/) right now. I'm considering the following topics for my talk submission:

1. Authorization using Oso
2. How to build a Discord Bot

I might go ahead and submit both. I really miss speaking at events in person though.
