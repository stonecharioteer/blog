Reflections on Doing More
==========================

.. note::

   This post originally started off as something on how I'm trying to learn more.
   It *meandered* into **Dear Diary** territory, but there's a certain flow to it,
   in my opinion. I'm keeping it as it is, and releasing it without edits.

I have been struggling to do more lately. It has become really hard to sit down
and study, for example. I have been the sort to learn and study to improve
myself, but truth be told, I have always felt I can do more.

I have an uncle who believes those of us in the technology world are entitled,
that we aren't contributing *any real work* to the world. I am slowly
distancing myself from him because I don't need that sort of toxicity in my
life. That's his opinion and he's entitled to it, pun unintended.

I want to do more, though. Not because of what he said. I'm doing so much
better than almost my entire family in terms of my career, but I am constantly
feeling like I should be doing more. I felt the same at Visa, and it's a weird
sensation.

I thought I did more at GKN, and I've recently had a chance to speak with my
old boss. He asked if I wanted to return, and I remembered why I left
immediately after spending an hour talking to the man. I loved working for him,
but it was a silo. I don't want to work in a silo anymore. I want to work with
a *crew*, with tools that empower me. Money isn't the only bargaining chip in
this world. Sure, we are paid far better than most other people.

I have since found great people to work with, just by being in touch with them,
I'm learning so much. I am realizing that the sheer amount of knowledge in our
domain that is happenstance is so strange. You learn because of a casual
conversation. You learn because a colleague comes over to your desk and sees
you using ``history | grep -i <something>`` and is astonished that you don't
know ``CTRL-r`` and ``fzf``. And that leads you down a path where you learn to
customize your shell to make you bleed productivity.

And that's a problem somehow. You have been optimizing productivity so much
that you are now *empowered* to do work.  You feel like you've been given
superpowers and you don't have a problem to solve. You feel crippled by the
fact that at work, you're not solving hard problems. You're relegated to
solving problems which are... trivial in your eyes.  Things that others should
be solving. Your powers could be put to use solving some other things.

You later realize that you're never going to be solving such problems in the
*real* world. You should instead focus on trying to do these things on your own
time. But the creative exhaustion of working in tech is real. You get burnt
out.  Yet, you want to do more.

It's odd, really. I once thought that if I had a job that was easy and paid me
more, I'd be satisfied. I guess that's the naivete in me.

I feel more troubled by the fact that I don't have a challenge at every
workplace I've been than I have ever been. It's odd because at a factory, I
felt like I had things I could improve, and a chance to do so, albeit without
the superpowers I have now.  Software is such a strange place to be because you
get to do things with minimal cost. Writing code isn't going to cost you
anything - atleast that's what you *tell* yourself. Perhaps so.

I am currently stuck where I am, mentally speaking, because I am unable to
focus on anything really.  I have had a *hard* year. I enjoyed *none* of it. I
bought a car and immediately had an accident that nearly killed someone.  She
lived, and is well now. My family contracted Covid-19, and my mother went to
the hospital. I thought I nearly lost her.  My sister got married, and while
*most* people consider that a celebration, I do not do well in crowds. The
sheer level of disappointment I had in my family and the way they treat me
became too hard to bear. I cannot stand them. I am the black sheep in this family,
and I will *never belong.*

I moved to a larger house (with my parents), adopted a *second* cat, and I
changed my job. I lost someone I considered a dear friend, because he was
trying to use me for a *patent* on something I was working on with other
colleagues. I also became really aware of how alone I feel since I don't have
anyone in my family that I relate to.

2021 has been *ugly* to say the least. It is my least favorite year in my life,
and I cannot wait for it to end. Yet, I want to get to the bottom of why I
don't have the energy to do more.

I feel... like I've not accomplished anything. I impulsively buy things I do not need,
and do not have much in the form of savings. I need to save more money, but it's so hard to
stop myself from buying things, especially technology-related. I feel strong *anxiety*
whenever I take an interview, mostly because I feel I've not prepared enough. Especially data structures
and algorithms rounds. I'm lucky to have landed the jobs I have *besides* that, of course,
but I want to face this fear.

I tried therapy earlier this year, to try and examine my lack of focus, as I considered it.
I ended up talking about all the things that happened to me, in the 3 sessions I had this year.
It wasn't an easy year, and I couldn't find the answers to my lack of energy to doing more.

I hope to find that answer, and that focus soon. I have so much I want to do, and so much more.
