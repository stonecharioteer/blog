This is Not a Blog
==========================

   :Date: 2022-07-22


As of this post, this website ceases to function as a *blog*. What does that
mean? I have been thinking about the kind of content I want to put out and I
realized that I don't like to blog format. If the reasons don't matter to you,
you can be assured that I will continue to write posts and publish my notes and
thoughts, just that I won't be attaching chronological limitations to them.

.. note::

   I must confess that a lot of this comes from `this post
   <https://www.gwern.net/About#information-organizing>`_ and I agree with what
   Gwern says with regards to how to organize content

I am abandoning the blog format for the following reasons.

1. I want to continue to write using Sphinx, which, in my opinion, is the best
   framework for static-site generation you can find.
2. I like `ablog, <https://github.com/sunpy/ablog>`_ but I've been meaning to
   switch to the `Furo theme <https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo>`_ and ablog
   `doesn't have support for it. <https://github.com/sunpy/ablog/issues/108>`_
3. I don't like how I've organized my content for the past few years and I'm
   overhauling all of it. Some of my long-form post ideas were severely limited by
   the format and have been in draft-limbo forever.
4. This way, I can update my website without worrying about whether I'm
   publishing new content or not. I've always primarily written for myself, so
   this should become easier.
5. I can finally use `the amazing index that sphinx </genindex.html>`_ creates
   instead of a rather useless wordcloud.

I'm happy with this change, but while this is going on, there will be a few
caveats to how my older blog-posts render. I'm trying my best to restore the old
style ``/title/`` format instead of the ``index.html`` or ``title.html`` format, but
it might end up being too much work. I'll also need to figure out how to not
breakt the RSS format. But these are things I'll update later.

----------------
What changes?
----------------

1. I will *update* posts whenever I need to, so instead of the pages being
   static, the content will evolve and change.
2. I will also start tackling some of the long-form posts that I have been
   meaning to write. I have been putting them off because of the format.
3. Finding some of my older posts might be difficult for now, but I *will* fix
   this. However, the sphinx search page is amazing and you should try to use
   that to find it.
4. The ref:`index <genindex>` is going to be the most powerful feature you can
   find on this website. I'm also going to see about trying to render an epub
   and PDF when I have more long-form articles.
5. The biggest change you will see is that my *fictional* content will also
   start featuring on this webpage.
6. Sometimes, by *necessity*, I might need to publish updates or date-specific
   posts, which I will do and feature on the homepage.
