Works by Bibek Debroy
============================
.. note:: 

    These are not *reviews*, since I cannot really be unbiased about
    Mr. Debroy's works. Instead, I'm reproducing letters of correspondence
    that I've sent to him over the years. It started off with the Mahabharata letter, after reading the 10 volume translation over a period of 18-20 days in the ruins of Hampi, progressed to the Harivamsha, some unrelated questions/essays, and then the Ramayana.
