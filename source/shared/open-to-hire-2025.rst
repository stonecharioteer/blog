.. admonition:: Currently Open to Hire
   :class: warning

   I'm currently looking for my next role, and if you'd like to reach out,
   here's my `resume.
   <https://github.com/stonecharioteer/blog/releases/latest>`_

   I code in Python, Rust, and some Javascript. I'm looking for challenging
   roles in an architect or lead position where you're dealing with distributed
   systems that boggle the mind. I've also worked with GenAI and Blockchain in
   the last few years. Hit me up if you want to discuss how cool Rust is!
