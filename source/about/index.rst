About Me
==========

Hi! I'm Vinay Keerthi.

   :alt: I taught myself how to swim!

   This is me. I love to swim!

.. admonition:: Currently Open to Hire
   :class: warning

   I'm currently looking for my next role, and if you'd like to reach out,
   here's my `resume.
   <https://github.com/stonecharioteer/blog/releases/latest>`_

   I code in Python, Rust, and some Javascript. I'm looking for challenging
   roles in an architect or lead position where you're dealing with distributed
   systems that boggle the mind. I've also worked with GenAI and Blockchain in
   the last few years. Hit me up if you want to discuss how cool Rust is!

I am a software developer based in Bangalore, India. I write about technology,
Rust, Python, Raspberry Pi, the Internet of Things, and I also speak at Meetups and
Conferences.

I used to work at **ChainSafe,** where I work on tools and libraries to help further
web3 and blockchain-related tech. I've also worked on some cool LLM projects
that I'd love to talk about.

Previously, I've worked at **Merkle Science,** where I've built tools and ETL
pipelines for cryptocurrency-analytics, and at **Visa Inc,** building tools and internal
services that powered the Data Platform team, and before that, I worked at **GKN
Driveline,** helping the engineers automate mathematical calculations that power
cars around the world.

The stuff I enjoy building are usually distributed systems, developer tools and
the odd automation that no one else usually enjoys. I love making things work
like clockwork.

I have a :ref:`code of values<personal-code>` that I adhere to, and I
constantly try to adhere to it.

I love to read, swim, and write. I will often write about tech, culture, mental
health, and swimming.

I also write about hearing loss and single-sided deafness, and how to cope with
it.

You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn or Email, though I'd rather you just send
me a tweet.

   The Stone Chariot of Hampi - Art by Sthuthi Kiran

I was born in Hampi, Karnataka, India, and I often write about it as well.  I
was lucky enough to find the domain, and the ID in all my frequent portals.

Dog Tax
--------

Meet my dog: her royal highness "Subbalakshmi" (Subbi). We've had her since
Sept 2019, and she's one of the friendliest dogs we've met. She's an indie,
adopted off the road when she was a few weeks old. She's the cuddliest thing
ever! My mother named her Subbi, a word that usually denotes a rather cheeky
young girl. We turned that name into Subbalakshmi, because Subbi is also
usually a nickname for that.

Cat Royalty
-------------

As of August 2023, I have one dog and three cats. All 4 of these were adopted
off the streets, directly and *sort of* indirectly.

Vibhishana
================

I got a cat in Jan 2021, and his name is "Vibhishana" (Vibhi). He's an indie
too, and I got tricked into adopting him and becoming his servant. He doesn not
love cuddles. My mother named him after `Vibhishana, the brother
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibhishana>`_ of `Ravanasura,
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana>`_ because she said he looked like a
Rakshasa, but since he was ours, he was a good Rakshasa.

Ganga

   Ganga

I have always wanted more cats, so I adopted this feisty monster in October
2021. Her name is Ganga, and she's just as naughty as her elder brother, if not
more so. I named her Ganga, and this is the *only* one of my pets that I
named, because she would climb the windows at night, get on the curtain
rods, and then yowl at me so I'd wake up, get a stool or ladder, and then
beseech her to come down. She also had a bad habit of peeing on my feet
at night as a kitten. One night, at 3AM, I was tired, she was on the curtain
rods yet again, and reminded of `Bhagiratha
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagiratha>`_, who `beseeched the river goddess
Ganga to descend upon the Earth.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganga_(goddess)#Descent_upon_the_earth>`_ It was
fate that she was named Ganga, and trust me, she is as feisty as the river
herself.


The two of them love each other very much.

Yamuna
==========

Yami, Yamu, Yamuna, Kauveri, Pampa, Tungabhadra, Netravathi, Chandi Chamundi,
Kamakshi and Gowri. Somehow, the fact that my friend's mom named her meant that
she gets multiple names. Yami doesn't get along with the other cats (as of 2023
August), but I'm working on that. She is feisty, loves attention, and loves being
among people. She's indifferent about other animals.

I have joint ownership of her highness with my friend Sri, who told me to look after
her "for a week" in April 2022.

And *no. I didn't buy her.* Adopt, don't shop.

My Gear
---------

I am a certified geek. I build mechanical keyboards, run Kubernetes on a 4 node
Raspberry Pi 4 bramble (a smaller cluster), have about 18 Raspberry Pi boards
in all, and I also do a lot of MicroPython and IoT work.

I love Linux, and I enjoy tinkering around it, trying to disassemble how it works.

Here's a small gallery of my workspace.

Keyboards
----------

I assembled these keyboards and flashed the QMK framework on them, programming
them to suit my preferred layout.

Workspace
----------

This is my older workspace from my previous house. I've since moved into a
larger house, where my books are right behind mehouse, where my books are
right behind me.

New Workspace and Library
--------------------------

I moved into a larger house near a lake, and I'm glad I did, because I was
finally able to buy some IKEA bookshelves and arrange my books all around me.
I've also bought a gorgeous standing desk from Monarch Ergo, which I use for work.

For writing, I've bought a custom made desk that's mostly commandeered by my cats.
