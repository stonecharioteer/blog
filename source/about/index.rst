About Me
==========

Hi! I'm Vinay Keerthi.

I am a software developer based in Bangalore, India. I write about technology,
Rust, Python, Raspberry Pi, the Internet of Things, and I also speak at Meetups and
Conferences.

I currently work at **ChainSafe,** where I work on tools and libraries to help further
web3 and blockchain-related tech.

Previously, I've worked at **Merkle Science,** where I've built tools and ETL
pipelines for cryptocurrency-analytics, and at **Visa Inc,** building tools and internal
services that powered the Data Platform team, and before that, I worked at **GKN
Driveline,** helping the engineers automate mathematical calculations that power
cars around the world.

The stuff I enjoy building are usually distributed systems, developer tools and
the odd automation that no one else usually enjoys. I love making things work
like clockwork.

I have a :ref:`code of values<personal-code>` that I adhere to, and I
constantly try to adhere to it.

I also write about hearing loss and single-sided deafness, and how to cope with
it.

You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn or Email, though I'd rather you just send
me a tweet.

My Gear
---------

I am a certified geek. I build mechanical keyboards, run Kubernetes on a 4 node
Raspberry Pi 4 bramble (a smaller cluster), have about 18 Raspberry Pi boards
in all, and I also do a lot of MicroPython and IoT work.

I love Linux, and I enjoy tinkering around it, trying to disassemble how it works.

Here's a small gallery of my workspace.

Keyboards
----------

I assembled these keyboards and flashed the QMK framework on them, programming
them to suit my preferred layout.

Workspace
----------

This is my older workspace from my previous house. I've since moved into a
larger house, where my books are right behind mehouse, where my books are
right behind me.

New Workspace and Library
--------------------------

I moved into a larger house near a lake, and I'm glad I did, because I was
finally able to buy some IKEA bookshelves and arrange my books all around me.
I've also bought a gorgeous standing desk from Monarch Ergo, which I use for work.

For writing, I've bought a custom made desk that's mostly commandeered by my cats.

I was born in Hampi, Karnataka, India, and I often write about it as well.  I
was lucky enough to find the domain, and the ID in all my frequent portals.

Dog Tax
--------

Meet my dog: her royal highness "Subbalakshmi" (Subbi). We've had her since
Sept 2019, and she's one of the friendliest dogs we've met. She's an indie,
adopted off the road when she was a few weeks old. She's the cuddliest thing
ever!

Cat Royalty
-------------

I got a cat in Jan 2021, and his name is "Vibhishana" (Vibhi). He's an indie
too, and I got tricked into adopting him and becoming his servant. He doesn not
love cuddles.

More Cat Tax
--------------

I have always wanted more cats, so I adopted this feisty monster in October
2021. Her name is Ganga, and she's just as naughty as her elder brother, if not
more so.

The two of them love each other very much.
