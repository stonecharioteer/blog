===========================================
A Random Walk Through the SQLite Codebase
===========================================

.. note::

   I am not ready for this talk yet. I want to use this and the :ref:`Redis code
   read <talks-redis-code-read>` as exercises in learning C. There's a lot to learn from both of them.
   I want to essentially start with discussing the architecture of SQLite,
   and how that is implemented in the code. It could be along the lines of
   Anthony Shaw's CPython Internals article, but not to the extent of his book.
