Building a CLI in Rust using ``clap``
=======================================

.. note::

   This is straightforward in what I would like to talk about.
   I want to discuss the ``clap`` crate and how you'd use it to
   build a CLI with subcommands, and even more.

   I'd like to discuss both the Builder API and the direct API (I'm not sure
   what this is called).
