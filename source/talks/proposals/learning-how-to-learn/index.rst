Learning How to Learn
==========================================

.. note::

   This is a personal talk that is only tangentially linked to technology. I
   want to talk about being Bipolar, and having a learning disability. I want
   to discuss how I learn, and how I learnt learning. I want to discuss things
   that worked for me, and how to assess learning methods.
