**Engineering Manager / Lead Software Developer** | **Fully Remote** | **November 2022 - February 2025**

* Managed a team of 4, providing technical and career-based guidance.
* Worked on **Python** and **Rust** based tooling for developers, including internal
  monitoring scripts, data-quality alerting systems and setup **dagster** for data pipelines
  for accounting and blockchain event tracking.
* Evaluated **LLM** based tooling for management, investigating cost vs benefits to automate
  report generation and automated cleanup of github projects and issues.
  Worked with **OpenAI ChatGPT 4** and **Llama 3.1**
* Worked on building a custom **LLM** that interfaces with internal and external APIs,
  providing a chat-based interface for managers to track and manage their teams'
  OKRs in line with the organization's goals.
* Worked on building an inhouse **LLM** that uses Solidity audit data to
  provide customers with a bot that can assist them in self-audits.
  This used Llama 3.1 and stored the training data on Chroma DB.
* Created dashboards and metric collectors for EVM wallets to track balances
  and alert cross-chain contract creators when the balance is below the
  threshold.
* Worked with external stakeholders for proof-of-concept in projects across blockchains, including,
  but not limited to, nym, filecoin and **ethereum**.
* Worked with technology leaders in requirements gathering, writing work
  proposals and ran sprints with developers to meet customer deadlines.
* Reviewed **Rust** code across projects, providing insight into improving code
  quality and adherance to the core spirit of the language.
* Worked on a **Rust** networking library integrating ``libp2p`` with blockchain
  protocols.

  **CLI** that facilitates the movement of data across data stores, and opens up
  our data layers for quality and consistency-related metrics, using **Rust**.
* Designed the alerting system for all our services.
* Designed and wrote the data quality service using **Rust** - this application goes
  through the data of various **blockchains** to identify missing or newer data.
* Reworked the internal packaging system to leverage modern **Python** practices such as ``poetry``.
* Designed a load-balancer to place over our blockchain nodes (internal and
  vendor-hosted). Led a team of 2 engineers who built this.
* Designed and wrote a websocket client to ingest blockchain data from various
  websocket implementions of chains using **Rust.**
