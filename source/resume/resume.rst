**Technical Team Lead** | **Fully Remote** | Started: **November 2022**

* Managed a team of 4, providing technical and career-based guidance.
* Worked on building a **GPT** that interfaces with internal and external APIs,
  providing a chat-based interface for managers to track and manage their teams'
  OKRs in line with the organization's goals.
* Worked on a networking library integrating ``libp2p`` with blockchain protocols.
* Reviewed Rust code across projects, providing insight into improving code
  quality and adherance to the core spirit of the language.
* Worked with technology leaders in requirements gathering, writing work proposals and
  ran sprints with developers to meet customer deadlines.
* Worked on POCs for an ``ssv`` **Rust** implementation.
* Worked on building tooling for ``foundry`` to deploy to multiple chains using the ``Sygma`` framework.
* Worked on **Python**-based tooling for developers, including internal monitoring scripts.

Merkle Science
-------------------------------

**Lead Software Developer** | **Bangalore** - **Remote** | Started: **JULY 2021 - November 2022**

* Built a team for internal tooling, managed scouting for talent, hiring and
  interviewing.
* Created a **Rust** library for the **Polkadot** blockchain for internal use, exposed
  via ``PyO3`` and ``maturin`` into **Python.**
* Created a **Rust** library for **Hedera hashgraph,** to ingest data from the mainnet
  API into our local data stores.
* Conceptualized and developed the data-engineering toolkit - a multi-faceted
  **CLI** that facilitates the movement of data across data stores, and opens up
  our data layers for quality and consistency-related metrics, using **Rust**.
* Designed the alerting system for all our services.
* Designed and wrote the data quality service using **Rust** - this application goes
  through the data of various **blockchains** to identify missing or newer data.
* Reworked the internal packaging system to leverage modern **Python** practices such as ``poetry``.
* Designed a load-balancer to place over our blockchain nodes (internal and
  vendor-hosted). Led a team of 2 engineers who built this.
* Designed and wrote a websocket client to ingest blockchain data from various
  websocket implementions of chains using **Rust.**
* Overhauled **Apache Airflow DAGs** for modularity.
* Developed a central **Python** library for all utilities and internal code.

VISA Inc.
-----------------

**Sr. Software Engineer - Data Platform** | **Bangalore** | **MAY 2019 - June 2021**

* Designed and spearheaded the security portal project, a REST layer that
  facilitates automation of Qualys security updates for PCI compliance while
  adhering to company-specific rules regarding service availability, using OSS
  and internal APIs to minimize maintenance time. Reduced contractual manpower
  by 75% and downtime by 70 hours a month for 2400 servers.
* Developed a library to create concurrent and self-cleaning containerized
  sessions that can be used to automate parallel workflows for testing and
  automation of complex applications: example threat analysis of cross-border
  transactions using a single VISA card.
* Mentored college graduates to build their first applications, integrating
  native pipelines, helped them craft detailed documentation and tune the performance
  of their apps.
* Developed internal tools to orchestrate servers, including a tool to run
  parallel ssh-based connections, like ``ansible``, but with company-specific requirements.
* Designed and developed a tool that allows developers to quickly get started with
  projects, building pipelines and bootstrapping the initial code for them, while
  setting up quality checks, running automated tests and uploading artifacts to
  the right registry in JFrog Artifactory.
* Conducted Python workshops with a varied audience, training them on how to set up
  Python projects, how to package them and how to build python modules so that they are
  shareable.
* Mentored and trained SDE-1s and interns, guiding them in design and implementation details.

**Developer** | **Bangalore** | **DEC 2015 - MAY 2019**

* Built a company-wide search engine that indexed all files in an Elastic-Search
  server and allowed users to query even the contents of files such as spreadsheets
  *and* 3D models of Gearboxes using specific classification criteria.
* Built wrapper libraries in Python leveraging ``PyCuda`` and NVIDIA libraries
  for engineers to use within ``Jupyter`` notebooks.
* Managed ``Jenkins`` pipelines and ``Subversion`` source code registry singlehandedly.
* Designed and developed a microservice-based application to automate complex
  engineering pipelines involving proprietary software and protocols.
* Designed the system interaction and data pipelines for a large-scale
  application that submits HPC jobs to servers placed across the world.
* Conducted annual training in Python and Data Analytics for Mechanical Engineers.

**Copy Editor / Developer** | **Bangalore** | **FEB 2014 - DEC 2015**

* Used ``PyQt`` and ``Python`` to build a work allocation tool for writers,
  that allowed them to report their work and set up pipelines for editors
  and content-creators to leverage their output.
* Created an application to generate thousands of
