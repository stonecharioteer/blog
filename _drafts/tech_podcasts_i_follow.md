## Talk Python To Me

[Site](https://talkpython.fm/) \| [Podcast RSS](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/rss) \| [Podcast RSS (All Episodes)](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/rss_full_history)

Talk Python is a fun podcast on Python that a friend introduced to me. I *began*
listening to podcasts *because* of it.

This podcast is hosted by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy), who
also co-hosts the Python Bytes podcast with Brian Okken.

## Test and Code

[Site](https://testandcode.com) \| [Podcast RSS](https://testandcode.com/rss)

[Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken) is a well known author in the Python space. His book on [Python Testing with pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest). In this podcast, Brian focusses on Python and other technology in the testing space.

I recommend this podcast to anyone who is wondering how they should structure their tests when coding in Python, and when wondering about what practices to follow when coding in general. Brian is Michael's co-host on the next podcast.

## Python Bytes

[Site](https://pythonbytes.fm/) \| [Podcast RSS](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/rss) \| [Podcast RSS (All Episodes)](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/rss_full_history)

Python Bytes is a short podcast (around 15 minutes an episode), about the latest bites of news in the world of Python. Brian Okken and Michael Kennedy (and an occasional guest) give great updates on the different headlines, and they reach out to their twitter followers who let them know about all the greatest modules out there. Follow to learn more about Python.

## The Python Podcast.`__init__`

[Site](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/) \| [Episodes RSS](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/feed/mp3/)

Tobias Macey has some of the *best* guests on his podcast. I cannot state this enough. I love this podcast a lot lately because it rates high up when it comes to *intermediate* content in the learning space. If you have been coding in Python for a while, you *should* definitely listen to all his episodes.

## Vim Tips with Ben

[Site]() \| [Episodes RSS]()

This podcast is no longer maintained, and the last episode was on 2016, but if you are trying to learn Vim, this is absolutely high up there in what you need to listen to.

I recommend listening to *all* the episodes, since there are only a few.
