Day Eighteen
In the aftermath of the battle and after all the funerals, Krishna instructs Dharmaraja to go and seek Bhishma's teachings. On his deathbed, Gangeya recites the hundred names of Vishnu, and begins revealing the nature of Dharma.
He teaches Yudhishtira how to be a just king, and how to rule over the kingdom. He expounds the ways to placate the gods, the way to attain moksha and the means by which Yudhishtira can make amends for the sins of war.
The Shanti Parva has to be the most astounding part of the Mahabharata, for in it, it reveals Indian culture and explains why grandmothers teach the things they do. I do not agree with any of it, but it is truly a deep read.
Sitting here, next to the most iconic part of Hampi, I cannot wait to finish the last two books of the Mahabharata.
Today, I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. In doing so, I went to my most favourite part of Hampi, and sat in plain view of the Stone Chariot. Perhaps when I finish it, it will deign to move, and bring about pralaya.
