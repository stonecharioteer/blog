Wherever I sit down in Hampi, I can't help but ask myself if once, a long time
ago, Krishnadevaraya walked past this very spot. I wonder if I have walked
along paths he liked to walk through, I wonder if he could appreciate the
poetry of sitting under a tree to read the Mahabharata.

The Mahabharata is daunting in scope. I sat under this tree and read of the
lament of Damayanti as her husband Nala forsook her in the woods. I read how
Bhima scolded Yudhishtira for being weak willed at the dice game. And I cheered
as Arjuna fought the Trymbaka Karpadin himself, the Great Shiva, to prove his
worth.

I wonder if Krishnadevaraya read these same scenes somewhere in Hampi.  Today I
went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. My only neighbours
were birds hungry for the snacks my aunt packed for me, and perhaps the ghost
of Krishnadevaraya.
