I needed a place to collect my thoughts on various topics related to technology, in a slightly less-public manner. That's where my new [notes website](https://notes.stonecharioteer.com) comes in.

I'm going to be keeping my notes on interview preparation, general learning, language-specific notes and other errata there. I'll be still
uploading posts to this blog, but I would like to keep the notes mostly to myself, in a format that's more accessible to me.
