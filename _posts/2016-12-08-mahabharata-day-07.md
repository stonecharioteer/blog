As I read the Mahabharata today, a British lady came up to me to ask me about
Hampi. She was wondering if the heat had something to do with global warming. I
assured her that it has always been this hot here. It's why Krishnadevaraya
built so many pushkarinis, and why the landscape is filled with mantapas for
weary travellers to rest as they walked in the hot sun.

Indeed, even the trees seem to be growing where travellers can find shade. Even
the trees want to help travellers rest.

As I sat under such a tree and looked at the place where the Monkey God Hanuman
was supposed to have been born, I read of Bhima's encounter with his half
brother, and of Markandeya's words to Dharmaraja. I read the words of Droupadi
to Satyabhama, her answers regarding the duties of a wife. I also read of the
reunion of Partha with his brothers, as he descended Indraloka with the weapons
of the gods.

Today, I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. As I read,
I could hear the wind blow down from the Anjanadri Parvatha, and I wonder if
Vayu was listening as I read how Bhima defeated Jatasura.
