Karna.

Oh Karna!

My aunt tells me that her favourite character from the Mahabharata is
Vaikartana Karna. The son of the Sun, the unwanted Kounteya.

Dhaana, Veera, Soora Karna.  When Indra asked for your Kavacha and Kundalas,
you gave them up, knowing full well that he was doing it to make you vulnerable
in battle. When you were faced with the task of taking down Ghatotkacha, you
used the Pashupati weapon, knowing that it would return to Indra after one use.

Oh Vaikartana! How can anyone not cheer for you? Even given your hatred for the
Pandavas?

Cast away by Kunti, tricked by Vaasudeva, you have always been forsaken what is
rightfully yours.

Today I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. I sat in an
abandoned temple to Vishnu, and spoke to idol, asking him why he constantly put
the Suryaputra in pain. As I read about Karna's death, I moved away from the
shade and sat under the light of the sun. It seemed fitting that way.
