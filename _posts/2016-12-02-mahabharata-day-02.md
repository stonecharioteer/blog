It is unbelievably calm atop a hill. I was right when I chose this spot to read the Mahabharata.
Reading of Shakuntala and Dushyantha, I lost myself in her pain as he denied loving her. Reading about Yayati and how he beseeched his sons to share with him their youth, I could agree with him that one thousand years could never be enough time to enjoy the wonders of this world.

As I read, someone in the distance began to play the flute. It was someone selling flutes, perhaps, but in this valley you cannot say how far sound travels.

I stood at the edge of the temple I have made my reading nook and read out into the winds.

Today, I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra and I did.
