## Introduction

I've wanted to read the postgresql documentation live, on video, for over a
year now. This is the best time to do it.

A friend once told me that he considers PostgreSQL to be one of the
best-documented pieces of OSS software out there, and after recommending it to
several of the engineers I work with, I agree. Reading the PGSQL docs is
something I enjoy doing every once in a while. However, I've not done this at a
stretch of a weekend or even a week.

I've been toying with the idea of doing webcasts for coding for quite some time
now. This was the first thing I wanted to live-cast whenever I got around to
it.

## Why

This is a question that you shouldn't be asking if you know me. I love teaching, and I love technology. I'm doing this *for the fun*.

That being said, I have the following goals:

1. Start my Twitch Channel
2. Organize my thoughts in a Notion workspace, leading to further blog-articles later in August or September.

## Scope

I'm going to be reading the PostgreSQL database documentation
[from the website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/index.html).
I'll be reading v13.3, the latest as of this post. I'm going to work through
all the examples / code in the documentation, and I'll also be recording the
entirety of the exercise.

There are a few exclusions, however:

1. I won't be working on any of the Windows and Mac-based steps.
2. I will be doing this on a Linux Mint / Ubuntu-based machine, and compile times may be faster than you see here since this is entirely on an SSD.
3. I will be skimming through some sections, mostly around the C programming
   sections since I don't really know how to code in C.
4. I will also skip sections that are in different programming languages (perl etc.)

## Logistics

I'm going to be streaming on [my Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/stonecharioteer).

I will be going live at 8PM IST on 2021-07-03.
[Here's a calendar invite](https://dateful.com/eventlink/5564772587)
for the entire session, should you need it.

## Prerequisites

Anyone is welcome to join, even if you're mildly curious. I won't be coding to
be honest with you, so you won't need to know any programming language to
follow along. I'll also be using Linux to run all the commands I read, so you
might learn a few things about Linux as well.

The notes for this entire session will be recorded on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/A-Weekend-With-PostgreSQL-68b98f680d8c4cbdb0f80fb99223c742). I'll work them
into detailed blog posts later. I want to dive into some portions of this more
than others.
