I have been meaning to do a Flask workshop for quite some time now. The guys
at the BangPypers meetup have been asking me to do this as well. So we finally
set a date and got around to it.

The video was livestreamed over Zoom and Youtube. Unfortunately the Zoom
comments were not read out loud, so those have not been preserved.
