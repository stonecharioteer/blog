My very first introduction to the Mahabharata was one of two comics, from Amar
Chitra Katha, bought at the railway station in Mumbai, over twenty years ago.

It was either the story of Karna or the story of Abhimanyu, I cannot recall
which one it was. I remember reading both when I was younger and being
enthralled with the battles they fought. Both, naturally are tragedies,
extremely famous.

As I sat in a temple which is empty most of the time, I read of the fall of
Bhishma and Abhimanyu today. Such tragic tales these are! Oh, Gangeya! Why
couldn't you have been the sire of the Kuru lineage? Why did Shantanu have to
crave the touch of Matsyagandhi? Oh, Devavrata? Why did the fisherman have to
demand such a deadly price of you, and why did you have to take that terrible
oath? Perhaps with you on the throne, Dharma would have been stalwart. Perhaps
that way you could have avoided your bed of arrows?

Oh Soubhadra! Why did Dharmaraja have to send you, a child, into the
Chakravyuha? Why did Dhananjeya not teach you how to emerge out of it after
breaking through it's defence? Why, Abhimanyu, why did Drona have to instruct
Jayadrata and Karna on how to defeat you? Why did he have to point at your
bowstrings?

Today I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. As I read,
I played with a smooth pebble that seemed like a miniature of the boulder that
held up the temple where I sat.
