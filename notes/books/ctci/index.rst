Cracking the Coding Interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell
=========================================================

This book is recommended reading material when preparing for technical
interviews.  However, all of its examples are in Java. In these notes, I'm
going to maintain solutions for all the exercises, and examples, in Python.
I'll stick to Python 3.8 and above, where applicable.

I recommend getting a physical copy of this book to read along with my notes.

While the initial sections of the book dwell on the pre-interview process,
I do not find them *too* relevant to me. I am going to focus purely on the
problem-solving skills.
