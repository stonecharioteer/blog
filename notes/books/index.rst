.. note::

   This section contains my notes on various *technical* books I am reading
   or have read. Like the rest of my *notes* section, these are largely WIP,
   since I'm migrating them from various other locations.

   Cracking the Coding Interview
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This book is touted as the *best* resource for preparing for tech
   interviews. One caveat is that all the examples are in Java. I'm maintaining
   notes and solutions to *all* the examples in Python here.

   Designing Data-Intensive Applications
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Martin Kleppmann's book is the best resource on preparing to understand
   scale and how large tech organizations manage to meet their requirements.
   This book is *mandatory* reading once a year to keep up to speed on
   how to scale applications.

   Database Internals
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   While all of us use databases, Alex Petrov is an expert in how they work.
   This book is an excellent resource in understanding what happens under the
   hood of databases.

   Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms using Python
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This is the companion book to the :ref:`course-mit6.006` course. I read
   this book everytime I'm preparing for interviews, and the notes
   I've made help a lot.
