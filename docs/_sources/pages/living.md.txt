## Journals


Some of these posts have no publication dates, and they are **live-journals**.
I will be adding to them constantly, and I will only post a blog article about
these updates.


### Technical Journals

These are largely tech-oriented. Right now, there is only one tech journal.

1. [Notes on MIT 6.824 - Distributed Systems](/distributed-systems.html)
2. [Today I Learned](/til.html)
3. [Tech Podcasts I Follow](/tech-podcasts-i-love.html)
