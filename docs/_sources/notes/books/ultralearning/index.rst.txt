Chapter 2 - Why Ultralearning Matters
-----------------------------------------

* Explains **what** Ultralearning is.

  * Strategy
  * Self-directed
  * Intense

* Ultralearning is an *investment* into your *work*.
* Ultralearning is a way to *improve* your personal life.
* `Tyler Cowen - "Average is over." <https://tylercowen.com/average-is-over/>`_
* Skill Polarization
* Education - Tuition is too high
* Technology - New frontiers in learning

  * Ultralearning does not require new technology.

* Professional success was rarely the thing that moticated the ultralearners -
  including those who ended up making the most money from their new skills.
  Instead it was a compelling vision of what they wanted to do, a deep
  curiosity, or even the challenge itself that drove them forward.
* The best ultralearners are those who blend the practical reasons for learning
  a skill with an inspiration that comes from something that excites them.
* Doing hard things, particularly things that involve learning something new, stretches
  your self-conception.
* Particular types of practice can change most attributes necessary for becoming an expert-level
  performer with the exception of the innate traits of height and body size. -
  `K. Anders Ericsson
  <https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/anders-ericsson-book-interview-peak-secrets-from/>`_
* Find time for ultralearning by doing it part-time. The core of the strategy
  is intensity and a willingness to prioritize effectiveness.
* A spread-out schedule may even be more efficient in terms of long-term memory.
* Pursue ultralearning during gaps in work.
* Integrate ultralearning principles into the time and energy you already devote to learning.
* Ultralearning doesn't have to be an additional activity; it can *inform* the
  time you already spend learning.
* Ultralearning is *learnable*.
