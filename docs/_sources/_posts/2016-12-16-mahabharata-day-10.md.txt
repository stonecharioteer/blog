# Reading the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra - Day 10

I am not reading these books at my usual speed. I could take the shorter way,
read at full speed from the comforts of my home, or I could do it this way.

![Mahabharata Day 10](/assets/images/posts/india/mahabharata-day-10.jpg)

From the top of a hill where the rishi Matanga meditated for centuries, where
he cursed the Vanara king Vali for his vile sin, I read Dhritarashtra's words
as he beseeched Vidura for guidance. He wanted to avoid the war at all costs,
but he didn't know how much Dharmaraja himself wanted to avoid war.

There's a saying in the Mahabharata. That which is here may be found else
where, but that which is not here is no where else.

Today, I went to read the Mahabharata by the Tungabhadra, and I did. I sat
under the hot sun of the Kishkinda region, looked down at the Achyutaraya
Temple, and reminisced about Krishnadevaraya and his time.
