# The ESP8266 Smart Watch


![Watch](/assets/images/posts/iot/esp8266-watch.png)

A while ago I bought this amazing watch. Well, it isn't really a watch, more of a WiFi DeAuth devicstme that has an ESP8266 underneath. I am going to flash MicroPython on this thing and hook it to the K3S cluster through MQTT. 

Here's a preview video of this watch. I didn't test what it can do (yet), but I will do so on my spare Wi-Fi router.

Watch this space for more. I have a lot of ideas about what I can do with this thing. *rubs hands in glee*.
