# My Notes

I needed a place to collect my thoughts on various topics related to
technology, in a slightly less-public manner. That's where my new
[notes website](https://notes.stonecharioteer.com) comes in.

I'm going to be keeping my notes on interview preparation, general learning,
language-specific notes and other errata there. I'll be still uploading posts
to this blog, but I would like to keep the notes mostly to myself, in a format
that's more accessible to me.
