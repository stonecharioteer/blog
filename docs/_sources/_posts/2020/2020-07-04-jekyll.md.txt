# Blog Updates

I am ditching Digital Ocean since I do not need a droplet to run the blog.
Github pages with Jekyll and the [YAMT](https://github.com/PandaSekh/Jekyll-YAMT)
theme suffice for now.

I hope to write more since I have these in place.

On this note, I am backporting a couple of articles from other sources.
