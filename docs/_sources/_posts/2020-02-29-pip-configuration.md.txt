# Configuring Pip to Work in Enterprise Environments

The hardest thing about using package managers within
an enterprise is getting them to download the packages
you need on the office network. Oftentimes, you are
hindered by SSL errors, and other times you get
bogged by DNS errors.

## Downloading External Packages

Most of us either disable SSL verification at this point
or contact IT about getting trusted certificates. The
former is a bad idea. The second option is not bad, but
it does lead down the rabbithole of "why do you need this
package?"

Instead, you should know that you can easily set some environment
variables to help with this.


```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://<username>:<password>@<proxy.company.com>:<port>
export http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://<username>:<password>@<proxy.company.com>:<port>
export https_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
```

This works for most tools. Some tools follow the Windows way, utilizing
the uppercase values, and some use the lowercase. Now that's food for
thought. If you are writing your own tool that works with the internet,
make sure to support *both* methods. This helps your users' experience
greatly.

The above settings should solve your *dns* issues, but they won't help
the SSL errors. For that, you will need to configure your tools
specifically.

For pip, the easiest way is to use the configuration file. Before you
do that, however, ensure you have updated pip to the latest version.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pip
```
