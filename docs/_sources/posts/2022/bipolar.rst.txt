Bipolar and ADHD -- I Know Your Names Now
===========================================

.. note::

   This post touches on the topics of depression, mental health, Bipolar
   Disorder and ADHD. If you're uncomfortable with these topics, this isnt' for
   you.

For the longest time of my life I wondered if I have ADHD. I dismissed that
feeling, and it didn't really affect me. I functioned, and I had moments of
sheer *inspiration.* I called this many, many things. At one point, I chalked my
bursts of productivity off to me being a person who likes operating in bursts.

I was convinced, however, that I had a learning disability as a child. I
performed inconsistently at school. My performance solely depended on the
teacher. If the teacher was the sort to explain from first-principles and grasp
my attention, I'd learn, and I'd learn *for life*. I genuinely do not forget
some things I've learnt this way. And teachers who were horrendous at teaching,
I've never grasped anything they've taught me. I'd obsessively learn things
taught by these good teachers because they managed to trigger a section of my
brain that *loved* learning. And I'd ignore the rest. It created a sinusoidal
performance, to say the least.

I began worrying about my lack of focus for a while now. I've not been *myself*
for a while now. I'd assumed it had something to do with the poor years I've
had since 2019 May. But I began to suspect it was something else in 2020, which
is when I began therapy.
