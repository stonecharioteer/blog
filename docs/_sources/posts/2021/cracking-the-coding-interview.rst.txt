Cracking the Coding Interview
========================================================

I have never been great at technical interviews. Not the kind where you discuss how to build
software, but the sort where you have to read a problem and translate that to
code in 45 to 60 minutes.

I'm terrible at it, because I haven't practiced doing those ever. Everytime I've had to look for a job,
I got lucky that my interviewer thought I deserved a pass at that round. I don't think counting on that
is a good thing. In fact, I am a staunch believer of `Spoelsky's 12 Questions <>`_ to tech companies,
especially the question that asks if programmers *write code during the interview* process. Is that
hypocritical of me? I'm not saying that I *hate* the coding process. In fact, I don't. I acknowledge
my lack of competitive programming prowess as a deficit in my own skillset. I don't want that to hang
over my head forever.

I want to master it, enough so that I can get over that trepidition that looms
over me whenever I do these interviews.  To that end, I'm charting myself a
plan, a roadmap for interviews.

I'm posting that below, so that I stay on track. Oddly enough, I've *always* been good on building
plans and calendars. I'm not certain I've been great following them, though.
